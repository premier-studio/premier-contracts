## Introduction

### Drip

Premier is a brand that specialize itself into the creation of **Drip**.

A **Drip** is a _new form of NFT_ that combines both an NFT and a usable asset. This usable asset takes a physical form in the real world and a digital form in the metaverse.

### Mint & Mutate

> We call "mutation" the process of combining a Drip with an NFT.

When minted, a Drip is in a **Default** state. It is free from any mutation.

In order to mutate a **Drip**, the only thing required is to have the NFT you want to mutate your **Drip** with in your wallet and execute an on-chain transaction.

⚠️ Once mutated, a Drip is indefinitely linked to the NFT it has been mutated with and its state will forever change to **Mutated**.

### Drop

Drips releases will be held under the form of **Drop**. A "drop" refers to the limited release of a an asset.

Each **Drop** will have its own usable asset. You can think of everything from a _skateboard deck_, to a _piece of clothing_ or even a custom _Rolex_, who knows.

## Contracts

> Premier's contracts are fairly simple as of now but they will get more complex along the way as new features gets implemented.

### Store

The `Store.sol` contract acts as an entrypoint. It holds a reference to each Drop in the Premier ecosystem.

### Drop

The `Drop.sol` contract holds all the logic behind a **Drop** release and its functionalities.
